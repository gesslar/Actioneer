# Actioneer

Actioneer is a small, focused Node.js action orchestration library. It provides a fluent builder for composing activities and a concurrent runner with lifecycle hooks and simple loop semantics (while/until). The project is written as ES modules and targets Node 20+.

This repository extracts the action orchestration pieces from a larger codebase and exposes a compact API for building pipelines of work that can run concurrently with hook support and nested pipelines.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
npm install @gesslar/actioneer
```

## Quick start

Import the builder and runner, define an action and run it:

```js
import { ActionBuilder, ActionRunner } from "@gesslar/actioneer"

class MyAction {
  setup (builder) {
    builder
      .do("prepare", ctx => { ctx.count = 0 })
      .do("work", ctx => { ctx.count += 1 })
      .do("finalise", ctx => { return ctx.count })
  }
}

const wrapper = new ActionBuilder(new MyAction()).build()
const runner = new ActionRunner(wrapper)
const result = await runner.pipe([{}], 4) // run up to 4 contexts concurrently
console.log(result)
```

## Types (TypeScript / VS Code)

This package ships basic TypeScript declaration files under `src/types` and exposes them via the package `types` entrypoint. VS Code users will get completions and quick help when consuming the package:

```ts
import { ActionBuilder, ActionRunner } from "@gesslar/actioneer"
```

If you'd like more complete typings or additional JSDoc, open an issue or send a PR â€” contributions welcome.

### Optional TypeScript (local, opt-in)

This project intentionally avoids committing TypeScript tool configuration. If you'd like to use TypeScript's checker locally (for editor integration or optional JSDoc checking), you can drop a `tsconfig.json` in your working copy â€” `tsconfig.json` is already in the repository `.gitignore`, so feel free to typecheck yourselves into oblivion.

Two common local options:

- Editor/resolve-only (no checking): set `moduleResolution`/`module` and `noEmit` so the editor resolves imports consistently without typechecking.
- Local JSDoc checks: set `allowJs: true` and `checkJs: true` with `noEmit: true` and `strict: false` to let the TypeScript checker validate JSDoc without enforcing strict typing.

Examples of minimal configs and one-liners to run them are in the project discussion; use them locally if you want an optional safety net. The repository will not require or enforce these files.

## Testing

Run the small smoke tests with Node's built-in test runner:

```bash
npm test
```

The test suite is intentionally small; it verifies public exports and a few core behaviors. Add more unit tests under `tests/` if you need deeper coverage.

## Publishing

This repository is prepared for npm publishing. The package uses ESM and targets Node 20+. The `files` field includes the `src/` folder and types. If you publish, ensure the `version` in `package.json` is updated and you have an npm token configured on the CI runner.

A simple publish checklist:

- Bump the package version
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm test`
- Build/typecheck if you add a build step
- Tag and push a Git release
- Run `npm publish --access public`

## Contributing

Contributions and issues are welcome. Please open issues for feature requests or bugs. If you're submitting a PR, include tests for new behavior where possible.

## License

This project is published under the Unlicense (see `UNLICENSE.txt`).

## Most Portum

As this is my repo, I have some opinions I would like to express and be made clear.

- We use ESLint around here. I have a very opinionated and hand-rolled `eslint.config.js` that is a requirement to be observed for this repo. Prettier can fuck off. It is the worst tooling I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing (no offence to Prettier) and I will not suffer its poor conventions in my repos in any way except to be denigrated (again, no offence). If you come culting some cargo about that that product, you are reminded that this is released under the Unlicense and are invited to fork off and drown the beautiful code in your poisonous Kool-Aid. Oh, yeah!
- TypeScript is the devil and is the antithesis of pantser coding. It is discouraged to think that I have gone through rigourous anything that isn't development by sweat. If you're a plotter, I a-plot you for your work, and if you would like to extend this project with your rulers, your abacusi, and your Kanji tattoos that definitely mean exactly what you think they do, I invite you to please do, but in your own repos.
- Thank you, I love you. BYEBYE!
